# Tea-Website-Project

Another project that I did using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I made an E-Commerce website about specially crafted tea products.

It is called Tea Station. I structured it and divided into 6 different sections.
- Header, About, Products, Services, Contact Form, Footer.
I used Font Awesome for my icons and Google Fonts for my font-family.
I created a Formspree account (it's free) and used it to store all information submitted through my contact form such as name, email and message. It acts as the database of my program.

CSS custom properties (variables) is such an essential tool for this code. It acts as a customizable variable where you store properties that can be used throughout your code. I love how it is reusable and easy to change its value.

Most of my layouts were done using Flexbox properties. FLEXBOX WAS THE BEST THING EVER HAPPENED TO CSS!!!! It made my whole experience easier to design and build this website without having to use tricky hacks and a lot of float and position properties in my code.

Media Queries played a big part as well. Every device has its own screen dimension hence, they all deserve the appropriate layout! And lastly, pseudo classes were very helpful in the responsiveness of anchor tags.

I hope you like it! ENJOY!
